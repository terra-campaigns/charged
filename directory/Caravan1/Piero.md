Liberal Engineer (24): You have failed in your career in the Hegemony Capital.

You are rugged with tanned skin and braided hair. You have a square face and your speech is booming. You are dressed in livery. You are merciful but also lazy. You are 49 years old.

Mystical Third Eye
This mutant can open a mystical third eye on its forehead. When the eye is closed, it cannot be detected; when open, it gives the mutant special powers that can affect everyone the third eye can see.
Powers: Sense evil, good, and lies

Your mutation takes 1 of your inventory slots.

Attributes: STR 11 DEX 10 WIL 14
You can swap two of these.

Hit Protection (HP): 1

Starting Equipment
Â£ 6, Rations (3 uses), Lantern (3 uses), Duck Pistol (d6, BLAST, Very Short Range), Sack Of Ball Bearings And Screws

What did you buy in preparation for today?: A long scarf and very warm hat.

What's your most recent project?(it was a fluke, you can't recreate it): Primordial Slime - Can be rubbed onto skin, leaving it soft and jelly-like. You can now bend and squeezeas if you had no bones or internal organs, but you only benefit from RESTS while in water. If you spend aday out of water the effects wear off.

You are in debt with The Tin Soldiers: The first of you to die can be reproduced in living metal form (ARMOUR 2, but much slower than normal) if you wish.

Silvester velho, chapeu cartola.
Fake intellectual.
