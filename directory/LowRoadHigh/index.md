The cratered viaduct of the High Road runs on crumbling pylons of dying dryland coral across the pallid grasses. Beneath the half-passable testament to the follies of the Long-Long-Ago, the Low Road winds, smeared threads of soil and loam and oil and blood ground into a hard surface by the pounding feet, hooves, wheels, and treads of pilgrims, nomads, caravans, and vechs.

Village-camp of retired caravanserais that were not posh enough to retire in [Violet City](../VioletCity/index.md).
It is a good place to trade for used caravan equipment and animals.


## Crystal Spire

## Motor outcrops
2 days southeast.
A gorgeous, striated ridge, left over from some incredibly aesthetic
geological process
