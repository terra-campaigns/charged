What do you always carry with you? Yellow cape of pure steel silk. 

You have an odd family connexion: Relative executed for treason. Was it just? 

You have an additional experience: Aristo. Engineered at source for their role (Narco-herbalism increased to d8 when relevant). 

Why are you on the road? Looking for new lands for the lost tribe (Foraging increased to d8).
