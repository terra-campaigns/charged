What do you always carry with you? Cabochon ruby with a regal hologram inside.
Who is your nemesis since childhood? Now a successful banker. Never forgets a slight (name a skill they taught you, and increase it to d8 when relevant).
You have a machine interface: Hacker subverting the surviving golem routines (use d8 when relevant).
Why are you on the road? Possessed by a demon in childhood (choose an item or name and increase a skill).
