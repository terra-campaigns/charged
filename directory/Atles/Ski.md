What do you always carry with you? Manual of the vechs, annotated with scribbles.
You have a machine interface: Infected with microplastic synthetic animalcules (increased Vome Tech).
You have a sign of the Fast Stars: Voidskiff. A silver ship in the heart (use d8 when relevant).
Why are you on the road? Compulsion after meeting a seer (increased Hallucination).
