[Atles](../../directory/Atles/index.md)' caravan is stationed on [The Low Road and The High](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/index.md).

## Camping grounds

[Tifixa](../../directory/Atles/Tifixa.md), [Kur](../../directory/Atles/Kur.md), [Cozarin](../../directory/Atles/Cozarin.md), [Horto](../../directory/Atles/Horto.md) and [Iacum](../../directory/Atles/Iacum.md) decide to work together for a week or so, on their exploration.
They learn that the [Iridescent Globes](../../directory/FoldedBelow/IridescentGlobes.md) are worth â‚¬ 500, but can be sold for more than that for magitech buyers.
The crystal shards are worthless at least until [The Last Serai](../../directory/LastSerai/index.md).
They learn of some business opportunity on the [Motor Outcrops](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/MotorOutcrops.md) and some trade patterns of cosmic scales being procured far west, beyond the [Fallen Umber](../../directory/FallenUmber/index.md).

## To the Crystal Pylon again

The group ponders and decides to go again to the [Crystal Pylon](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/CrystalPylon.md).
Under the pylon, in the pool of water, they find some bronze coins with the face of a joker.
On the rock walls at the back, they see what looks like a mollusc shell fossil.
Under closer inspection, the shell moves and starts approaching the group.

Tifixa names the mollusc [Shaggy](../../directory/FoldedBelow/ManEatingMolusc.md), and offers it a cup of coffee.
Shaggy opens its multitude of eyes and mouths within tongues within mouths within tongues.
It tries to swallow her arm, but Horto intercedes with one of his weapons and shoots the tentacle, ripping it from the main body of the creature.
Over time, Tifixa develops two children's eyes on her forearm.

## Geometric patterns

The eastern caves have art on their walls, painted with blood.
They are all geometric shapes, with no explicit language to them.
They indicate a known joke under closer inspection of Kur.
As Kur interprets them, a hand from the dark side of the south corridor starts to interact with the archaeologist.

The group calls the person [Fleshy](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Skinwearer.md), as it seems to wear an oversized flesh over its flesh.
It has limited intelligence but can communicate simple concepts and accept coffee.
It points at the shapes in the walls, at itself, and then to the south.
Its eyes start to shine, not unlike the [Iridescent Globes](../../directory/FoldedBelow/IridescentGlobes.md).

## Map of folded spaces

As the group continues south, the cave walls give way to walls built of red bricks.
After cleaning the covering mould, they find bas reliefs of monsters and men that remind them of the documents found in the room to the north.
At the end of the corridor, the lock at the door explodes with another of Horto's guns.

Cozarin goes first and sees an animated armour waking up from its slumber.
The construct comes towards the vampire and steps on a pool of blood.
Cozarin ignores the armour and starts drinking from the pool.
Iacum and Kur figure out how to turn off the magitech machine.

While this happens, Tifixa reaches for a stone table in the room and reads a [folded-space map](../../directory/FoldedBelow/index.md).
Do these rooms connect places that are distant from each other?
Even worlds?

The west wall of the room has another door, which is also locked.
The group goes back to their camp.
