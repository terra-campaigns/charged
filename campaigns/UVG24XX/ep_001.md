## The largest, most successful fantastic caravan of all time

The Catlord announces, through his director, [Atles Dello Citranella](../../directory/Atles/Atles.md), that their caravan is formed.
They will leave [Violet City](../../directory/VioletCity/index.md) and travel west, and become rich.

Several smaller caravans, financed by their financiers, join Atles Dello Citranella's caravan.

[Pilik](../../directory/Atles/Pilik.md), [Xulio](../../directory/Atles/Xulio.md) and [Ski](../../directory/Atles/Ski.md) try their luck with the Cat-lord and ask for some merchandise they could help move.
The Cat-lord is not pleased.
The director quickly takes notes on a "Discomfort Caused Fee" they need to pay by November, €500 each.

[Morgoth](../../directory/Atles/Morgoth.md) and [Kur](../../directory/Atles/Kur.md) agree with Pilik, Xulio and Ski to travel together, ahead of the main caravan, the next morning.
**They all carry lots of fancy tubers and want to sell them.**

## Vorgo is stabbed

Before sunrise, the purple haze dissipates early on a lucky day, and the five caravaners walk past a suburban bar.
Pilik remembers this bar well.
Cat-loving people are dominating the party.
Not allowing others to have fun.

Suddenly, a sunburnt man, with pink hair, staggers out of it, cruelly stabbed, sprays crimson bubbles and groans, “A behemoth’s pearl for dear Cubina.”
Morgoth helps him and notices there are some silver marks on the wound.
They need to drug him with morphine for the pain.
He is loaded unconscious into one of the mules.

The others go inside the bar.
The men who stabbed him are not there anymore, and some patrons talk about a dog cage.
**He is too drugged to be interested in fancy tubers.**

## Yellow beer

One day on the road, they arrive at the last place to say goodbye to the violet lands:  [Last Chair Saloon](../../directory/VioletCity/LastChairSaloon.md).
Atop the robin egg blue walls of some long-ago fort or tower, Marsa Vinoble operates the Last Chair Salon.

Morgoth buys some Yellow beer to trade it afterwards.
**Marsa did not want to buy fancy tubers.**

## Reckless red ritualists (RRR)

On the sixth day on the road, the group see a many-tentacled avatar of the Dead God summoned by [reckless red cultists](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/RRR.md).
The group avoids proximity and travels around them.
**Better to not even ask about the fancy tubers.**

The caravaners arrive at [The Low Road and The High](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/index.md).
