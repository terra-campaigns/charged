The Hero put the cat coffee in the samovar and rubbed the sleep sand out of their eyes.

On the other side of the hotrock, the Dwarf rubbed magitechnical ointment into the joints of his golem armour.
That meant it was half an hour to sunrise.
Same thing, every day like clockwork.
Perhaps he was clockwork.
Everyone said those Salters weren’t human anymore.

The Demon-Talker sat beside the Hero, noiseless as always yet somehow comforting.
The Hero passed her a cup.

“Ah,” she gurgled, “you make the best brew. 
It almost warms my bones.”

“We’ll all be warm soon,” rumbled Eater-of-the-Dead from its sleeping sack, “we’re nearly at the Violet City.”

## Play

Players describe what they do.
The GM advises when their action is impossible, demands a cost or extra steps, or presents a risk.
Players can revise plans before committing to change goal/stakes.
Only roll to avoid risk.

## Rolling

Roll a ***skill*** die — d6 by default, higher with a relevant ***skill***, or d4 if hindered by injury or circumstances.
If helped by circumstances, roll an extra d6; if aided by an ally, they roll their ***skill*** die and share the risk.
Take the highest die.

|         |                                                                                                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1-2** | **Disaster**. Suffer the full risk. <br>GM decides if you succeed at all.<br>If you risk death, you die. |
| **3-4** | **Setback**. A lesser consequence or partial success.<br>If you risk death, you’re injured.              |
| **5+**  | **Success**. The higher the roll, the better.                                                            |

If success can’t get you what you want (you make the shot, but it’s bulletproof!), you’ll at least get useful info or set up an advantage.

### Advancement
When the highest die rolls max, you may turn it into a **1** to increase a **skill** (d6→d8→d10→d12).

### Defence & harm

Say how one of your items breaks to turn a hit into a brief hindrance.
A broken gear is useless until it is repaired.

Injuries take time and/or medical attention to heal.
If killed, make a new character to be introduced ASAP.
Favour inclusion over realism.

## Caravaning

### Sacks

Inventory is abstracted in **Sacks**.
A **Sack** is:

- All your adventuring and professional gear. If in doubt whether something is available in your **Sack**, roll your skill die.
- A **Sack** of supplies is enough food, water and toilet paper to survive a week.
- One unconscious human.
- A unit of trade goods.

### This week the caravan is...

The flowchart below establishes the rules for running caravans.
Roll a d20 in most of the tables.
For those who go to 20+, you may add your **skill** die to the roll.

## GM

Describe characters in terms of behaviours, risks, and obstacles, not skill dice.
Lead the group in setting lines not to cross in play.
Fast-forward, pause, or rewind/redo for pacing and safety; invite players to do likewise.
Present dilemmas you don’t know how to solve.
Move the spotlight to give all the time to shine.
Test as needed for bad luck (e.g., run out of ammo, or into guards) — roll a die to check for (**1-2**) trouble or (**3-4**) signs of it.
Improvise rulings to cover gaps in rules; on a break, revise unsatisfactory rulings as a group.
