## To the Crystal Pylon

[Atles](../../directory/Atles/index.md)' caravan is stationed on [The Low Road and The High](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/index.md).
The place is nothing more than a camp of retired caravanserais.

![](../../imgs/gallery/Pasted%20image%2020250707091725.png)

[Pilik](../../directory/Atles/Pilik.md), [Kur](../../directory/Atles/Kur.md) and [Tifixa](../../directory/Atles/Tifixa.md) leave the camp and decide to travel north, at night, to the [CrystalPylon](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/CrystalPylon.md).
As archaeologists, that is where they think they should be.
As they travel, Pilik sprains his ankle on the metal debris that litter the area.
He complains for hours, until he forgets, when they all see....

The sun rises and reflects first on the massif northeast.
Then, it lights the giant crystal pylon far ahead.
Finally, the sun's rays hit the crystal spheres, supported by crystal rods.
A laser beam starts to form, connecting the spheres and the pylon.

The group realised other rods and spheres existed further south, but they are now destroyed, and their crystals lie in the steppes.
Tifixa, with her blue hair, connects with the laser's field, which takes its blue colour.
As a science experiment, Kur tries the same, and his hair is now like Tifixa's.

## The drawer

They finally arrive at the pylon.
The laser lands on an eroded half sphere on the crystal structure.
Pilik finds a man sleeping under the grass as he searches for an interface to open the pylon.
[Kur (or the barista version of Kur)](../../directory/Atles/Barista.md) introduces the group to "his" loot - the pylon.

Interfaced with the male plug of the pylon, Pilik opens a drawer with a hole.
It fits two people at a time, and they enter the pylon's catacombs.
Inside, the sound of falling water.
Below, shimmering lights, like white candles around water.

## Iridescent globes

The group explore the cave system.
Around a pool of water, [iridescent globes](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/IridescentGlobes.md).
Pilik captures one and uses it as a lantern.

In the second cave room, they find a collapsed wall and a corpse in a hole.
Barista enters and finds a rusted porcelain prince's sword and a golden chalice.
The deceased was hit on the head badly before falling here.

In the built room, in the south, they find some parchments that look like a historical study.
They refer to a cult in white lab coats and plastic protective glasses.
These cultists pay reverence to monsters of all kinds.

Kur finds footprints of people dragging their feet.
"Zombies?".
The group decides to capture the other globes and return to the camp.
They will be back for more.
