[Atles](../../directory/Atles/index.md)' caravan is stationed on [The Low Road and The High](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/index.md).

## Ash rain

After a week of haggling in the camp, a day starts with dark skies.
A fine rain begins but is replaced by a rain of ash.
Everyone in the camp has to wear damp cloths for breathing, and stumble as they walk with their eyes closed.
However, some people float a few centimetres off the ground.

[Ski](../../directory/Atles/Ski.md), [Kur](../../directory/Atles/Kur.md) and [Murdock](../../directory/Atles/Murdock.md) study the ashes and conclude they are from some plant matter on fire.
Nothing suspicious about it.

## The werepug

As the night falls, the sky becomes clearer, and a full moon can be seen.
With that, some howling starts.
The sounds come from within the camp of retired caravanserais.

Some commotion in one of the corners of the camp.
Some shots and a heavy beast run towards the group.
It looks like a bipedal pug, with a massive head.

Ski laces the animal, and is pulled as a skier, drifting atop ash-covered grass.
Kur dunks out of the way, but hits the floor on his left side.
Murdock aims with his gun and shoots.
The bullet misses the head of the werepug and lands on Ski's left shoulder, who immediately lets go of the rope.

The beast jumps at Murdock.
The difficult breathing of a tired pug, rivers of saliva.
It opens its absurdly large mouth and licks Murdock.
Someone from the camp comes and complains about the damage the werepug left behind.

## Doors

The group goes to the [CrystalPylon](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/CrystalPylon.md) for a third time.
The werepug comes with them, and when the sun rises, it returns to the human form: [Vorgo](../../directory/Atles/Vorgo.md).
On the way, they loot some of the crystal spheres that ignited the laser during sunrise.

Below the Pylon, the flow of water is weaker.
Going first to the corridor southwest, they find a cast-iron door with several placeholder forms:
Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Star, Hexagon and Circle.
Kur tries the Star artefact he carries, which fits the position and unlocks something, with a hissing sound.

Deciding to investigate this door later, they return to where the robotic suit of armour was before.
The machine was turned on again, and this time, more lubricated.
Kur and Murdock can turn it off again, but not before it throws Kur against a wall, shattering some of his ribs.

They are all too tired and hurt, and decide to come back.
