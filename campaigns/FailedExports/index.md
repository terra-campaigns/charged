You have failed as citizens of your castes in the Hegemony's capital.
Since then, you have accumulated enormous debts with one of the capital's factions.

But your debts were collected by a Financier from the North.
This pioneer issued a permit to export you to the Violet City in the northern steppes.
Upon arriving in the Violet City, you can still acquire an import permit to return to the Hegemony.
But this will cost Â£3,500.

# System

***Failed Exports*** is a <a href="https://www.bastionland.com/2020/11/mark-of-odd-licence-and-srd.html" target="_blank">Mark of the Odd</a> campaign.
**UVG**'s <a href="https://wizardthieffighter.itch.io/uvg-free-player-guide" target="_blank">Player Guide</a> is available for free.
The required rules are self-contained on this page.

## Stats

`GUARD` Ability to avoid being wounded in combat.  
`STR` Fortitude and physical power. If ***0***, character is **Dead**.  
`DEX` Reflexes, poise and Initiative. If ***0***, character is **Paralysed**.  
`WIL` Resolve, psyche and intellect. If ***0***, character is **Broken**.  

## Play

Players describe what they do.
The GM advises when their action is impossible, demands a cost or extra steps, or presents a risk.
Players can revise plans before committing to change goal/stakes.

## Risks & Violence

A **Save** is a roll ***d20*** under `STR`, `DEX` or `WIL` to avoid danger from a risky situation.  

Each side declares their actions before rolling **Damage** (***d6***, ***d8*** or ***d10***).
When **Impaired** roll ***d4***.
When **Enhanced** roll ***d12***.
From the highest dice rolled, subtract the opponent's **Armour** (up to ***3***).
The remainder is subtracted from `GUARD`. 
While `GUARD` is above ***0***, opponent evades **Wounds**.  

When **Wounded**, damage is subtracted from `STR`.  
For **PCs**, a `STR` **Save** is required to avoid a **Critical Injury**, which disables and kills in an hour.  
For **NPCs**, a `WIL` **Save** is required, once, to avoid being routed.

**Blast Damage** rolls separately for everyone in the effect area.  

## Recovery

**Resting** for a few minutes, recovers all lost `GUARD`. It may waste time or attract danger.   

**Healing** take at least a week. This restores all **Stats** and may recover **Wounds**.

**Fatigue** is caused by extreme efforts.
It takes a night's sleep to recover.
Extreme effort when already **Fatigued** cause ***d6*** loss of `STR`, `DEX` or `WIL`.

When lacking crucial needs, a **PC** is Deprived and cannot benefit from **Rest** or **Healing**.

## Caravaning

### Sacks

Inventory is abstracted in **Sacks**.
A **Sack** is:

- All your adventuring and professional gear. If in doubt whether something is available in your **Sack**, roll your skill die.
- A **Sack** of supplies is enough food, water and toilet paper to survive a week.
- One unconscious human.
- A unit of trade goods.

### This week the caravan is...

The flowchart below establishes the rules for running caravans.
When required, roll ***d20***.
You may add d6 if you have a relevant background.
