You have failed as citizens of your castes in the Hegemony's capital.
Since then, you have accumulated enormous debts with one of the capital's factions.

But your debts were collected by a Financier from the North.
This pioneer issued a permit to export you to the Violet City in the northern steppes.
Upon arriving in the Violet City, you can still acquire an import permit to return to the Hegemony.
But this will cost Â£3,500.
