## Export permits

[Leonti Vites](../../directory/VioletCity/LeontiVites.md), a financier of the Adventure Bank, travels to Hegemony Capital to rent the debt of many failed Servitor caste workers.
Among them were [Ferno](../../directory/Caravan1/Ferno.md), [Juao](../../directory/Caravan1/Juao.md), and [Piero](../../directory/Caravan1/Piero.md).

Leonti explains that he will bring them to the north, where they can find caravan work, become wealthy, and pay the fee for an import license back home.
That fee will be £ 3.500 each.
He also lent each of them €1,000 so that they could set up their caravan.
In November, they need to repay that loan with 100% interest.

They fly north on a Zeppelin.
The craft flies for two days, crossing a mountainous sea, volcanoes to the east, and deserts.
It avoids the west due to the presence of hostile barbarians.
Arriving in the [Violet City](../../directory/VioletCity/index.md), a purple haze covers the west.

## Setting up a caravan

The quickly-to-become-three-friends decide to work together and set up a business.
They did not pay any license fee for it, though.
With their newly acquired mules, one war-horse, four papaleguas and one rider-slave.

They notice the city is full of cats, and they seem to be well-regarded animals.

## Chair saloon

The caravan travels 1 day west and reaches the [Last Chair Saloon](../../directory/VioletCity/LastChairSaloon.md).
They drink Yellow Beer, and Juão trades some papaleguas with a scarred man.
Ferno buys some Yellow Beer and puts it in the caravan.

From the saloon westwards, the group travels for about 7 days.

## Wisp & flowers

One night, Juão meets a light Wisp.
The Wisp tells him the story of all his flowers.
The next day, Juão agrees to meet all these flowers.

Although his friends try to convince him to go, Juão wants to hear the stories.

The group takes an extra day to reach The [O Caminho Baixo e O Alto](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/index.md).
