## A village of retired caravaners

The group arrives at [The Low Road and The High](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/index.md).
It is a village of retired caravans, where people sell old beasts of burden and leftover expedition equipment.
[Juao](../../directory/Caravan1/Juao.md) and [Piero](../../directory/Caravan1/Piero.md) intend to spend the next days learning more about the region and its trading opportunities.

They learn there is no market for Odd fruits west of here, since they are grown in the [Porcelain Citadel](../../directory/PorcelainCitadel/index.md).
Although alchemical lubricants are worth a lot here, proving the information they got from market research last week was worth it.

One night, [Juao](../../directory/Caravan1/Juao.md) is bitten by a scorpion spider trying to make a home in his hand.
## Discoveries

As the two caravaners continue asking around and strolling through the ruined viaducts of this village, they learn of three locations where people go for adventures or to chill.

[**The Rusted Hand of Victory**](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/RHV.md): 
A victorious hand rises from the ground, covered in graffiti. Near
the road, it is a popular picnic place.
They become afraid of a pack of monkeys that seems to take over the area.

**Crystal Spire**:
A voluptuously whorled crystal pylon lies on its side in a heavily
eroded crater.
They don't visit the location, although it is close by.

**Motor outcrops**:
2 days southeast.
A gorgeous, striated ridge, left over from some incredibly aesthetic
geological process

## Vome infection

The two men do some tourism on the ramps and viaduct.
They see below, in the grassland, a swarm of vome-possessed prairie dogs frothing as the dread mechanical ghost corrupts their neural matter. 
They think fast and throw some food at them to ambush them.
With the dogs gathered, Juão throws gasoline at them, and they are burned.
Returning to the village, they see the vultures coming for the dead matter.

One day later, a mule is lost.
Piero search for her and finds her feeding on some brains.
The mule starts to transform, converted over the days into a semi-vome biomechanical wonder.
It now feeds on ambient radiation and sunlight.
However, its cybernetic visage causes unease.

Before they depart for the Porcelain Citadel, a flock of Vultures attacks one of the tents.
They are bestial like the prairie dogs.
The tent, in which precise instruments were sold, was destroyed.
Barely anything is left to be traded.

## "Is Gude" guy

As they leave, a Rainbowlander caravan arrives with hundreds
of beasts, escorts, and cargoes of Rainbow Silks (€500 per sack).
The caravaners don't trade with them and leave for their next leg of the journey.

Their week of travel is uneventful until the last day, when they came across a traveller dying of vomish infection with eyes full of purple dreams, pockets full of Gude balls and a single-entry tablet to a Porcelain Citadel private club.
He is in love with the cybernetic mule.
The group has no food left, but they give him water and a (typical) mule to ride back to The Low Road and The High.
