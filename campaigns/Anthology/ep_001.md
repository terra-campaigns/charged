Nur, a stealthy priest, Ori I, a fearless scout, and Ori II, a zealous survivalist, decide to become rich caravaning the Ultraviolet Grasslands.
They get a loan from a lone satrap parasite and try their luck.
They depart west after trading and preparing for the first week in [Violet City](../../directory/VioletCity/index.md).

In their travels, they find a cat lord who presents Ori I with Cat Coffee.
But on the next day, the bluelander bestial man gave the caravan a chase, and they lost most of what they had.

#### May 15

They arrive at [The Low Road and The High](../../directory/LowRoadHigh/index.md) 16 days after starting their adventure.
