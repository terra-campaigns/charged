We've been extracting and benefiting from the jade industry for too long.
Each type of jade makes our lives easier.
Even the black ones.
We went too deep and too far.
The world now falls apart around us.

Rocks the size of buildings and neighbourhoods fly through the sky.
Winds are unpredictable.
Flying here is tough.
But I am a tough gal.

The black jades give some height.
And premonition.
They can still be found in old, ruined facilities.

I fly the High Performer.
Our Jade-powered Transforming Airship.
I fly in the name of my Queen.
Or ex-Queen.
Well, ex-raider Queen, Saffron Vulk.

The High Performer has many modes.
Fast.
Battle.
Hunger.

And белка (Bellka) is also there.
A tinkerer and drug addict.
Or a drug seller.
Something of the sort.

We fly through clouds.
We seek the jade.
A terrible noise, and the ship shakes.
A harpoon hit us!

A raider's harpoon.
They wheel us into their ship.
But I dunk!
I dunk my Queen!

The raiders are now being dragged behind us.
We hear them shouting hysterically.
They probably shit their pants now.

The tinkerer is not useless.
As the dunk happens, he greases up the ship's gears.
And my Queen!
We are now flying fast.

I don't understand why the tinkerer was doing it, pretending to be a squirrel?
That was odd.

The Queen shows us all, and the raiders, how brave she is.
That is my Queen!
She shouts and emboldens us.
What a morale!

Their captain commands the raiders.
A drunken, boisterous, loudmouth.
Carries a massive fucking blade.
And did I mention he was drunk?

"You lazy twats
Why are you afraid of this lazy &ˆ*$?"

"Look, it's the impotent drunk!"
Was this terrible man my Queen's ex?
Whatever happened before between them left my Queen on top.
And that helps us.

As this happens, I see a floating rock in front of us.
It is far enough that I can easily manoeuvre.
But the raiders did not see it coming.

Jeffrey Littlefinger's ship crashes.
We hear him crying from afar.
"Saffron... I will find you and catch you."

Later in the day, we see a massive airship.
It is broken.
Or is it an entrance?

Some "friendly" competition is already there.
Those people who bring cannons with them.
Some organised excavation.

They fire their jade-powered cannons.
I stall the High Performance.
She can't be hurt!
At the last minute, we dodge the bullet.

While they prepare to shoot again, our Queen...
She... she starts to make our airship into a ramming airship...
Is this a dream?

The shape changes, and a metal carapace builds up in the front of the vessel.
I **am** dreaming.
And while I try to steer the airship, the tinkerer attempts to make airbags.

At the last moment, I disobeyed my queen.
I don't ram into them - that would hurt the High Performer.
Instead, I land at their side.
A rough landing.

The "friendly" competition comes at us.
They are well armed.

The Queen shouts at me, calls me an idiot.
With her back and steam-mechanical spine, a cloud of hot steam jets at our opposition.
But they still surround us.

The Queen exchanges with them, but does nothing more than distract them.
I bring the harpoon chain from the back.
I tie them together with the chain.
The Tinkerer can still throw in some loose rocks, hoping they will trip on them.

As they trip over and twist their ankles, my Queen activates her steam spine.
She gets out of there with a fancy jump (and a lot of steam).
But they still grab her!

These men... they are touching her... those filthy hands!
I drop the chain and pull my Queen.
But I trip as I do it.
She is free - but now I am not.

The Tinkerer wants to spread oil on our opponents.
But the stupid did not see me there.
And I am also covered in oil now.

What ensues is what happens everywhere, all the time, since the beginning of time:
A bunch of men were overcoming two women who thought they were free. 
It was the Tinkerer who saved my Queen.
I was immediately free, too.

I run to the High Performer and get a lighter.
With it, I light these men up on fire.
But I am also lit!

My Queen berserk on them, as we still try to finish them.
And they get desperate.

The next seconds were fast.
But we won.
The women (with a Tinkerer man) won against these horrific men.
